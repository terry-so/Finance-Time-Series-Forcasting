    "# 🚀 LSTM Enhancement Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses specifically on testing LSTM enhancements to the xPatch model, following the project's architecture patterns for LSTM integration via `layers/network_lstm.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 LSTM Testing Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline vs LSTM**: Direct comparison of original xPatch vs LSTM-enhanced version\n",
    "2. **LSTM Configurations**: Test different LSTM architectures (hidden sizes, layers, bidirectional)  \n",
    "3. **LSTM + Directional Loss**: Combined enhancement testing\n",
    "4. **LSTM Parameter Sensitivity**: Analysis of optimal LSTM hyperparameters\n",
    "5. **Performance Impact**: Quantify LSTM's contribution to forecasting accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM should capture longer-term dependencies beyond patch-level patterns\n",
    "- **Sequential Enhancement**: Complement xPatch's spatial (patch) processing with temporal (LSTM) processing\n",
    "- **Architecture Synergy**: Validate the hybrid CNN-LSTM approach for financial time series"
